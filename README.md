# The Mission
`Open Gaming System` provides a robust, performant, and secure 
standard implementation of `GLI-19: Interactive Gaming Systems, Version: 2.0`. 

# Open Gaming System
iGaming (meaning: online casino games played with real money) is
on the rise.  The regulated gaming industry, as a whole, still
embraces closed-source proprietary software, and this is unlikely
to change any time soon.  Afterall, one's proprietary intellectual
property provides a competitve advantage to game manufacturers.

However, there is one broad area of activity that the regulated
gaming industry should implement using free and open source software;
particularly, a system like `Open Gaming System`.

# Why Open Gaming System?
Over the past thirty years or so of open source software development,
we have seen a robust information security industry develop to fill a
demand: providing counter-measures and defenses to security vulnerabilities.

`Open Gaming System` is developed under the public eye.  It's source code
is available for everyone to read, understand, and audit.
